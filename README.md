## Project Overview
The BA Flight Booking Prediction project focuses on predicting customer flight bookings for British Airways. It involves the following steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning, handling missing values, and preparing the dataset for analysis.
2. **Feature Engineering:** Transforming and engineering features to improve model performance.
3. **Model Training:** Training a machine learning model using Random Forest, a powerful algorithm for predictive modeling.
4. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluating the trained model's performance using cross-validation and relevant evaluation metrics.
5. **Insights Visualization:** Creating visualizations to interpret the impact of different variables on the model's predictions.

## Data Preprocessing
We started by cleaning and preprocessing the raw data. This involved handling missing values, converting categorical variables using one-hot encoding, and scaling numerical features.

## Feature Engineering
Feature engineering played a crucial role in improving our model's predictive power. We engineered features to capture relevant information and relationships within the data.

## Model Training
We trained our predictive model using the Random Forest algorithm. This algorithm provides insights into variable importance, allowing us to understand the key factors contributing to booking predictions.

## Model Evaluation
To ensure our model's generalization ability, we performed cross-validation and computed evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Insights Visualization
We visualized the model's insights by creating visual representations of variable importance. This helped us understand which factors had the most significant impact on predicting flight bookings.
